# Network Robustness Project

[![GitHub Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Network--Robustness--Project-blue)](https://github.com/yshv/Network-Robustness-Project)

Welcome to the **Network Robustness Project**, a cutting-edge exploration into the application of machine learning for optimizing and understanding the robustness of wavelength-routed optical networks. This project was initially developed as part of a third-year dissertation at UCL and has now been adapted for public sharing and further development. 

The **Network Robustness Project** explores the resilience and efficiency of interconnected systems, focusing on optimizing connectivity and ensuring uninterrupted services in complex network environments. This research delves into both theoretical modeling and practical applications, combining insights from graph theory, system dynamics, and real-world data.

## üõ† Project Purpose

The **Network Robustness Project** focuses on solving the computationally expensive **Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA)** problem in optical networks. This is achieved by applying **machine learning techniques** to improve the efficiency of predicting network wavelength requirements and robustness, particularly for:

- Erdos-Renyi (ER) graph topologies.
- Barabasi-Albert (BA) graph topologies.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Integer Linear Programming (ILP) Implementation:** Accurate but computationally expensive method for RWA.
- **Machine Learning Regression Model:** Provides wavelength predictions 412x faster than traditional methods.
- **Graph Theory Integration:** Analysis of graph parameters such as algebraic connectivity, diameter, and centrality to predict robustness.
- **Comprehensive Data Pipeline:** Generation and validation of 11,000 graph topologies for training and testing.

## üí° Use Cases

This project aligns with the goals of the **AI for Connectivity Hackathon**:

- **Educational Networks**: Optimizing school and public-sector connectivity to ensure equitable access to resources.
- **Disaster Resilience**: Enhancing network robustness to maintain services during natural calamities.
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Assisting policymakers and engineers in designing sustainable, scalable networks.
